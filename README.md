Random Guid/Uuid Generator extension for chrome
===============================================

This chrome extension was created to easily insert random uuid/guid (v4) strings into input fields and text areas.<br />
During development it was also necessary to be able to insert a sql timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh:ii:ss) so this was also added.<br />
<br />
The extension can insert the following strings into a input field (and textarea):

*  Random uuid v4
*  Null uuid (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)
*  Current date time 
*  Fake date time (2001-01-01 00:00:00)

The full .crx extension is also available for direct installation.<br />
